# Google Books Search

Another React website! This project is my first full stack react web application. The user can search for a book using the Google Book API and be presented a list of book titles, images, authors, and a description. Then the user can save the books to a database for later use.

This project also uses [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) to alert all users across different windows when a book has been saved or deleted.

## Built With
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)
* [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
* [MongooseJS](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
